* reviewing pull requests

## Contributing Code aka. The Pamphlet

* Pick a Ticket from the **Pick One** column at [waffle.io](http://waffle.io/hacken-in/hacken-in).
* Leave a comment that you want to work on this you ticket
* We will assign it to you and assist if you have any questions
* Start hacking
* Open a pull-request and work on a feature branch. During the work on your branch:
    * [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com):rainbow: compares the "code quality" and the code coverage with the master branch. Both should stay the same or improve, never get worse.
    * A CI server provides feedback for your branch. We're using [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org):construction_worker: to help us with this job.
* As soon as your feature is ready to be merged, you rebase the branch onto master and clean up your commit history
    * When you're ready, create a pull request.
    * We will review your branch and signal its readiness with a :shipit: or a GIF of our choosing. If there's feedback, we will discuss it with you. Don't worry - the worst thing that could happen to you, is being overwhelmed by a bunch of animated GIFs.
    * If you're good to go, we will click the shiny green 'Merge' button, and your ticket will be closed automatically.
    * Travis CI:construction_worker: runs the test suite, if everything is green, the master branch will be deployed to [master.hacken.in](https://master.hacken.in).
    * When we want to release it to production, we will make a pull request from the `master` branch to the `release` branch. Travis CI:construction_worker: will automatically deploy it.
* Welcome aboard! (You get extra points for deleting your old feature branch!)
