## Contributing Code aka. The Pamphlet

* Take over a ticket by leaving a comment and tell us that you want to work on this issue.
* Open a pull-request and work on a feature branch. During the work on your branch:
    * [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com):rainbow: compares the "code quality" and the code coverage with the master branch. Both should stay the same or improve, never get worse.
    * A CI server provides feedback for your branch. We're using [Codeship](http://codeship.io):ship: to help us with this job. Because we're huge CI fans, all builds will also be checked by [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org):construction_worker:.
* As soon as your feature is ready to be merged, you rebase the branch onto master and clean up your commit history
    * When you're ready, create a pull request.
    * We will review your branch and signal its readiness with a :shipit: or a GIF of our choosing. If there's feedback, we will discuss it with you. Don't worry - the worst thing that could happen to you, is being overwhelmed by a bunch of animated GIFs .
    * If you're good to go, we will click the shiny green 'Merge' button, and your ticket will be closed automatically.
    * Codeship runs the test suite, if everything is green, your feature is shipped to production.
* Welcome aboard! (You get extra points for deleting your old feature branch!)
